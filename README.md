# üì¶ Digital Twin for Sinter Quality Evaluation using SAM

This repository contains a segmentation pipeline designed for evaluating the quality of iron ore sinter. It uses Meta‚Äôs Segment Anything Model (SAM) to detect particles on a conveyor belt image and calculate critical quality metrics like the Sinter Quality Index (SQI). The project is part of a bachelor thesis at the Technical University of Ko≈°ice.

## üöÄ Features

- High-quality segmentation using **SAM ViT-H**
- Fine-tuned **LoRA + SAM ViT-B** variant for improved domain performance
- Calculation of:
  - Equivalent Circle Diameter
  - Bounding box & rotated minimum rectangle
  - Area, orientation, and axis lengths
- Visualizations: overlay, bounding boxes, histograms
- Sinter Quality Index (SQI) metric

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to install and configure the environment for running the segmentation system.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nazar1119/digital_twin.git](https://github.com/m-stredansky/bc_nazarii_tymochko.git
cd bc_nazarii_tymochko
```
### 2. Create a virtual evironment
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Python Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download SAM Model Weights

```
cd Sam_LoRA
curl -O https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth

cd ../system_files/SAM
curl -O https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
```

### 5. Clone the Official Segment Anything Repository

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

### 6. Prepare Output Folders

```
cd system_files
mkdir output_sam
mkdir output_lora
```
### 7. And then you also need to go to folder Sam_LoRA, then run this commands:

```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project false
poetry install --all-extras
poetry run pip install --upgrade gradio safetensors monai
```

### To start programm you need run this:
Run with ViT-H model:

```
python system_files/SAM/sam.py
```
Run with LoRA model:

```
python system_files/SAM/lora_segm.py
```
Then output will be saved into output_sam and output_lora folders
