# Digital Twin for Sinter Quality Evaluation using Segment Anything Model (SAM)

This project is part of a bachelor's thesis focused on analyzing sinter particle size and quality using AI-based image segmentation. It implements a digital twin simulation that uses computer vision techniques to detect sinter particles in belt images, calculate key metrics, and evaluate overall sintering quality using the Sinter Quality Index (SQI).
